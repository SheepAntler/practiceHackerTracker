# Time Log

| Date | Task | Hours | Notes|
|------|------|-------|------|
| 1/22/20 | Completed initial environment set-up/checks and completed Exercise 1 | 4 | |
| 1/26/20 | Watched Week 2 videos, practiced cloning and adding new repositories, and created initial practiceHacker files | 3 | |
| 1/27/20 | Completed Week 2 videos and started working in earnest on Exercise 2 | 4 | |
| 1/28/20 | Got Exercise 2 up and running--just need to add javadoc and pretty up the code now. | 5 | If I see another date, like, EVER, it'll be too soon. |
| 1/29/20 | Completed Exercise 2 (again) after hitting a snag this afternoon. Refactored, refactored, refactored. Result: much cleaner code + I feel a lot less like a hack/cheater/silly-billy. | 3 | What Elspeth learned the Hard Way: You have to use .toLocalTime() right away when you bring a date in from the db. If it's still a Date when you store it in an instance variable, it'll always be a Date. |
| 1/30/20 | Took screenshots of my working Exercise 2 for exercise "submission" and committed them to Git | 1 | |
| 1/31/20 | Watched the log4j videos and completed the week 3 activity. Next, onto JUNIT! | 2.5 | |
| 2/2/20 | Watched all week 3 videos (except for puzzle walkthrough) and read the JUnit documentation. | 2.5 | WOAH. READ THAT JUNIT STUFF AGAIN/LOOK UP SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IT, SPETHERS. I know that was a pretty bleak time last night, but you'll get it! |
| 2/3/20 | Watched/coded along with the practice Advent of Code puzzle solution and completed the practice ArrayList test cases. | 1.5 | |
| 2/4/20 | Finished writing required tests for Exercise 3 and added log4j.properties to the structure. Also: I wrote out a lot of code on paper to get myself in the right headspace to solve the puzzle and did a bit of research on iterating over strings/comparing indiviudal characters within them. | 1.5 | |
| 2/5/20 | Read in the puzzle input file and got some sort of final answer...we'll see if it's right! Also, got a good start on checkpoint 1: I edited the technology section of my README to be about my own project (finally!) and got a folder set up for my design documents. I also completed my user stories and started in on the user flow document as well. | 4.5 | |
| 2/6/20 | Started my wireframes. I got my "browser window" template set up in draw.io and created the landing page and a login page, but then draw.io lost its connection to Google's servers and I was no longer able to access any of my work through drive. I didn't know if my changes were getting saved, so I called it a night. | 3 | |
| 2/7/20 | Google's servers were back up, but I restarted my wireframes on MockFlow anyway. I recreated my browser window template, and then laid out about 10 of my wireframes. WOW, it took forever, but I'm happy with the results. | 4 | |
| 2/8/20 | Finally finished up my wireframes. Whew! Glad that's over. It was profoundly helpful--I'll write about that in my journal in a second here. I also completed my ProjectPlan.md, my MVP.md, and created some rudimentary database structures. | 6 | |
| 2/10/20 | I watched most of the week 4 videos and worked through almost all of the Hibernate Demo. Woah. Lots of Info! | 2 | |
| 2/11/20 | I finished up the week 4 demo, but ran into a snafu when trying to incorporate a test database. Hmmm...will debug tomorrow | 2 | |
| 2/12/20 | After much debugging with Zeph, we finally fixed our problems! (We were both having quite a time getting our tests to pass post-test-database. I also set up my practiceHacker directory and drew out some tables to prepare for my DAO exercise. User table, here I come! | 2 | NOTE TO SELF: YOU MUST ALWAYS COMMIT CHANGES TO THE DB IN YOUR DAO METHODS. |
| 2/13/20 | Good grief. Today was Project Lombok Day, and boy howdy, was it a DAY. "How hard could it be?" I said. "Four-minute video?! What a snap?" I said. It took me a little longer...but now I'm going to make everyone head these problems off at the pass with me in class on Wednesday. I started my professional development project site as well. | 4 | TODO: More research on Lombok, so you can add it to your site! |
| 2/16/20 | I took an Enterprise hiatus because of a concert weekend and now I am paying dearly for it! I was about to start my week 4 exercise when I realized that my project was not, in fact, a Maven project. I don't know how on Earth this hadn't come to my attention, but here we are. After trying in vain to convert it from a regular old java project into a Maven project, I decided to cut my losses and rebuild my repo/project structure. Once that was done, I completed the week 4 exercise. | 5.5 | I have a question about assertSame(element, elementToCompare)--I am using it in a test, but even though the values returned are identical, the test still won't pass. I will do research on this once my mind is less mushy. |
