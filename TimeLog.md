# Time Log

| Date | Task | Hours | Notes|
|------|------|-------|------|
| 1/22/20 | Completed initial environment set-up/checks and completed Exercise 1 | 4 | |
| 1/26/20 | Watched Week 2 videos, practiced cloning and adding new repositories, and created initial practiceHacker files | 3 | |
| 1/27/20 | Completed Week 2 videos and started working in earnest on Exercise 2 | 4 | |
| 1/28/20 | Got Exercise 2 up and running--just need to add javadoc and pretty up the code now. | 5 | If I see another date, like, EVER, it'll be too soon. |
| 1/29/20 | Completed Exercise 2 (again) after hitting a snag this afternoon. Refactored, refactored, refactored. Result: much cleaner code + I feel a lot less like a hack/cheater/silly-billy. | 3 | What Elspeth learned the Hard Way: You have to use .toLocalTime() right away when you bring a date in from the db. If it's still a Date when you store it in an instance variable, it'll always be a Date. |
| 1/30/20 | Took screenshots of my working Exercise 2 for exercise "submission" and committed them to Git | 1 | |
| 1/31/20 | Watched the log4j videos and completed the week 3 activity. Next, onto JUNIT! | 2.5 | |
| 2/2/20 | Watched all week 3 videos (except for puzzle walkthrough) and read the JUnit documentation. | 2.5 | WOAH. READ THAT JUNIT STUFF AGAIN/LOOK UP SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IT, SPETHERS. I know that was a pretty bleak time last night, but you'll get it! |
| 2/3/20 | Watched/coded along with the practice Advent of Code puzzle solution and completed the practice ArrayList test cases. | 1.5 | |
| 2/4/20 | Finished writing required tests for Exercise 3 and added log4j.properties to the structure. Also: I wrote out a lot of code on paper to get myself in the right headspace to solve the puzzle and did a bit of research on iterating over strings/comparing indiviudal characters within them. | 1.5 | |
| 2/5/20 | Read in the puzzle input file and got some sort of final answer...we'll see if it's right! Also, got a good start on checkpoint 1: I edited the technology section of my README to be about my own project (finally!) and got a folder set up for my design documents. I also completed my user stories and started in on the user flow document as well. | 4.5 | |
| 2/6/20 | Started my wireframes. I got my "browser window" template set up in draw.io and created the landing page and a login page, but then draw.io lost its connection to Google's servers and I was no longer able to access any of my work through drive. I didn't know if my changes were getting saved, so I called it a night. | 3 | |
| 2/7/20 | Google's servers were back up, but I restarted my wireframes on MockFlow anyway. I recreated my browser window template, and then laid out about 10 of my wireframes. WOW, it took forever, but I'm happy with the results. | 4 | |
| 2/8/20 | Finally finished up my wireframes. Whew! Glad that's over. It was profoundly helpful--I'll write about that in my journal in a second here. I also completed my ProjectPlan.md, my MVP.md, and created some rudimentary database structures. | 6 | |
| 2/10/20 | I watched most of the week 4 videos and worked through almost all of the Hibernate Demo. Woah. Lots of Info! | 2 | |
| 2/11/20 | I finished up the week 4 demo, but ran into a snafu when trying to incorporate a test database. Hmmm...will debug tomorrow | 2 | |
| 2/12/20 | After much debugging with Zeph, we finally fixed our problems! (We were both having quite a time getting our tests to pass post-test-database. I also set up my practiceHacker directory and drew out some tables to prepare for my DAO exercise. User table, here I come! | 2 | NOTE TO SELF: YOU MUST ALWAYS COMMIT CHANGES TO THE DB IN YOUR DAO METHODS. |
| 2/13/20 | Good grief. Today was Project Lombok Day, and boy howdy, was it a DAY. "How hard could it be?" I said. "Four-minute video?! What a snap?" I said. It took me a little longer...but now I'm going to make everyone head these problems off at the pass with me in class on Wednesday. I started my professional development project site as well. | 4 | TODO: More research on Lombok, so you can add it to your site! |
| 2/16/20 | I took an Enterprise hiatus because of a concert weekend and now I am paying dearly for it! I was about to start my week 4 exercise when I realized that my project was not, in fact, a Maven project. I don't know how on Earth this hadn't come to my attention, but here we are. After trying in vain to convert it from a regular old java project into a Maven project, I decided to cut my losses and rebuild my repo/project structure. Once that was done, I completed the week 4 exercise. | 5.5 | I have a question about assertSame(element, elementToCompare)--I am using it in a test, but even though the values returned are identical, the test still won't pass. I will do research on this once my mind is less mushy. |
| 2/17/2020 | I implemented Lombok in my project and sample code in preparation for my presentation on Wednesday. Did a lot of research on Delomboking, and at Paula's suggestion decided to stop worrying about Javadoc for my boilerplate code--good to know! I also worked on my presentation website quite a bit--at least the initial build. I have a bunch of notes I need to type into it now! | 2.5 | |
| 2/18/2020 | I finished up my presentation website--it was hard work, but I'm happy with the result. Sadly, didn't get much else done, but the stuff I know about Lombok will save me (and hopefully everyone else) a bit of time now, so hooray for the Greater Good! | 4 | |
| 2/19/2020 | I did a bit of extra research on getting Hibernate and Lombok to work together this morning--I had a nail-bitey time getting my tests to pass before class, but with a bit of research I figured out a workaround! I'm glad I can share it with folks--I would have been the WORST advertisement for Lombok ever if I'd showed up with broken code. I also learned about circular dependencies, so that's good info to log away. | 2 | circular dependencies throw StackOverflowErrors--remember this! I have a feeling you'll see it again... |
| 2/20/2020 | Added equals() and hashCode() methods to my sample entities for easier testing. | 1 | |
| 2/23/2020 | Implemented the Mythical Generic DAO into my sample code--I wanted to build it all out there before moving it into my personal project, so I spent a good deal of time on this and learned a lot along the way. Tomorrow, I'll implement it in my project when I complete the Week 5 exercise. Wahoo! | 2 | |
| 2/24/20 | After a long concert weekend, I _FINALLY, AT LONG LAST_ completed exercise 5. I'm going to say more about this in my journal, because I hit a mental snag and it's getting me down. At any rate, a One-To-Many relationship now exists in my database, so there! | 4 | |
| 2/28/20 | I've missed a couple days of logging time, I'm afraid. I've been working through the Week 6 AWS activities amidst a slew of rehearsals for upcoming performances. Yay, springtime! Today, I got through the rest of the AWS deployment stuff, and got the User display exercise up and runnning. I also changed my MySQL password. | 3 | |
| 2/29/20 | I added some more classes and tests since last log--I've gotten my PracticeLog and PracticeHack classes up and running and tested, and today I implemented my Studio-User Many-to-Many relationship AND One-to-Many relationship. WHEW! Next, I just need to get Roles up and running. | 4 | |
| 3/1/20 | Today, I finally figured out my roles! Essentially, it's really a One-to-One relationship, I think--but I'll check that in Checkpoint 2 review to make sure that's A-OK. I've also now updated all of my tests to verify that my relationships are working. I should probably create a Roles test suite, too, AND I need to add tests for my CASCADE constraints. | 3 | |
| 3/2/20 | Checkpoint 2: Checked Off! I verified that my One-to-One roles relationship was not a horrible mistake, and now I'm all set to really work on the front end of my application. However, some conversations we had today made me think about how I might like to restructure my database--not necessarily to make changes to my app functionality now, but to allow for me to make changes/scale up more easily in the future. | 2 | |
| 3/8/20 | So, I thought JDBC authentication was going to be really hard, but it was actually super cool, and NOT nightmarish. Since last week (!!!!) I have spent a lot of time working through database issues I've been having--I can't seem to settle on a final design. I think I do finally have it down, though, which means I can FINALLY make some _real_ sample data to deploy/display on AWS. I made a separate instruments table, which right now has a One-to-One relationship with the User table, but which probably will transition to a Many-to-Many at some point, with a bridging table. Likely not this semester, but hey! It's nice to have the option without having to completely restrucure my entire database. This all took me a while--I'm going to guesstimate how many hours it was right now: | 8-10 | |
| 3/11/20 | I wish I could say that I'd charged ahead with a bunch of JSP stuff, but I really didn't. I'm sorry, me...but I was panic practicing and indulging in pre-spring-break malaise. I haven't added data to my real database yet because I've realized I want to add a couple fields to the user table and I'm not sure if I like the way the practice log table is set up to store times right now. I thought planning the database was going to be the easiest part. HA! | 2 | |
| 3/19/20 | I took some days off, but that's OK! Yesterday and today I made up for it by shelling out ALL of my JSPs...or at least what I *think* will be all of my JSPs. I even made some fancy nav bars that will change based on the role of the signed-in user! It feels really good to have this up and running. I even deployed to AWS at long last. It took me a while to get my JDBC Authentication working, but it ended up being something ridiculous, as usual--I had granted my tomcat user select privileges in the wrong database. GOOD DOG, ELSPETH. Next, I'll just display a bit of data, and then I'll be ready for checkpoint 3! | 5 hours on 3/18, 4 hours on 3/19 | |
| 3/22/20 | There should be a term for those times that you feel totally inept as a developer. I'm having the WORST time--I worked through all the API demo material, and came out on the other side feeling really confident, only to find that the IMSLP API I was planning on using was designed by a sadist and there is no other API that does the same thing on the market. I think I've got some re-thinking to do...I still might be able to salvage it, but it's going to take some brute force and likely some hideous code. I also found an open-source API that I might fork and add to, if I have time--it's out on GitHub, waiting for edits. It's called Open Opus, and it's already being used to interface with Apple Music and Spotify (both of which are pretty complex--I looked into them, and will need to do a LOT of research to make it worth my while to use either. also, they require users to have accounts to use them, which I think is pretty uncool. SoundCloud doesn't do that...maybe I'll use that in some way?). I'll get back at this tomorrow, but I'm not optimistic that I'm going to get it turned in on time...which probably means the same thing for Checkpoint 3, sadly. You can't win them all. | 7 | |
| 3/23/20 | It's like I can see the future--neither checkpoint 3 nor my week 8 exercise made it across the finish line this afternoon. It's OK, Elspeth! I forgive you. After class, however, after a bit of debugging that was full of "all is lost" moments, I *did* ultimately get my Checkpoint 3 done, so I'm going to make a video walking through that (and this) in just a second here. Also, Paula graciously walked me through some of the API problems I'd been having, so I'll hopefully have my week 8 exercise up and running before the end of the night as well. Even though I probably shouldn't have tried to implement it in my project right away, I'm glad I did--I know a couple classmates who are running into the same troubles as I have been, which means that I am acquiring important knowledge, no matter how hard-won it may be. A couple points off is totally worth it, I think. Now, I just need to figure out how the data I'm getting back from IMSLP and Open Opus will benefit my application--IMSLP doesn't really return what I hoped it would return, to be honest. But I'm going to make it work! | 10 | |
| 3/24/20 | Today, I finally worked through exercise 8 for real--I decided to forget about trying to get my TestServiceClient test to run and go straight to the good stuff--the actual DAOs/DAO tests. I'm glad I did--after staring at my classes for a good long time, figuring out how everything _really_ fits together, I reviewed the demo code and Paula's demo code one more as I re-generated my roboPOJO classes and constructed my DAOs. Now I see where I was going wrong before, which is great. I have a lot of thoughts about why I had so much trouble with something so straightforward, so I put them in my [Jibber Journal](JibberJournal.md) for future reference. I also spent a lot of time on the group project today, which is going to be documented in a file in that project's repo. I'll put those hours here, though. | 4 hours group project, 2 hours my project | |
| 3/25/20 | Group project, group project! I accidentally forgot to add the api.properties to the .gitignore file, so we spent a good deal of time putting out that fire. Matt has already done really incredible work. We made plans for the future, and I *think* know what some of my duties are going to be this week. We'll see what I accomplish. | 3 | |
| 3/27/20 | I watched the week 9 videos (finally!) and worked through as much of the demo as I could. Matt and I made plans to finish the demo up/work on the exercise together, as we both agreed that we really want to do this work in our project. | 1.5 | |
| 3/28/20 | Matt and I met up on Discord and worked through the rest of the week 9 demo. It took a lot longer than we anticipated, so we didn't actually get around to the exercise as we hoped. We made tentative plans to continue tomorrow. | 3 | |
| 3/29/20 | WHA-BAM! Exercise 9 is now done. Matt and I got all the week 9 stuff implemented in our group project and submitted it. Based on Paula's subsequent comments, I went back through the exercise once more later in the evening in order to make sure we could return JSON, HTML, XML, and plaintext to users of our web service. Also, I *totally* understand this project *WAY, WAY BETTER* now, and I also feel like I'm much better equipped to build a web service of my own, because I think I want to build one for classical music that will fit the needs of my application--not right now, of course, but someday down the line. I really do want to keep building my app beyond this class, as I feel that it fills a niche in the private music teacher community, and what I've learned over the past few weeks is that the API I want to use for my site JUST. DOESN'T. EXIST. | 4 | |
| 3/29-4/28 | WOW. I've been _legendarily_ bad at keeping this up to date, but today I'm going to forgive myself for that and turn over a new leaf! I'll also explain what's happened since my last entry: once the group project was over, I built a BOATLOAD of JSP shells and did a TON of JSP beautification. I did quite a bit of planning on paper whilst thinking/worrying my way through some mental blocks I came up against. Today, I forced myself to sit down and start the arduous task of building out my app's functionality through action servlets. I also did an enormous renovation of my app's login structure, because I realized that it was incredibly inefficient and wouldn't really even allow me to get data to display on the index page, so now I'm down a couple JSPs and a couple navbar templates, too. Pretty A-OK! Currently, I'm working on some page display items for logged in users, and I plan to be doing that for the rest of my work hours today. I feel like I'll get into a data-fetching rhythm pretty soon, but it feels a bit clunky right now as I'm figuring out how it all goes together. I'm working slowly, but it feels good to be back at it. | 4/28 hours: 5...before today, though? no idea. | |
| 4/29/20 | Today I really got stuck back into the project. I spent longer than I should have building out the forms for all the Create items in my app, but I feel like all of my JSPs *exist* now, so that feels good. I worked on getting my Index output working correctly, and got it set up for Students/PracticeHackers, but I left figuring the teacher leaderboards out till tomorrow, because that seems like it'll be a more arduous task. | 5 | |
| 4/30/20 | Today I got some rudimentary practice log data out on the page...I just wanted to make sure it was working before I formatted it for realsies. I also started working on the teacher index dashboard view...UGH. I got a list of students dumped out to the page pretty easily, but it's going to take a mild amount of malarkey to get the output to behave the way I want it to--especially since I have my database configured so that each teacher can have multiple studios with their ID--I want to output each studio's leaderboard separately, you see. I've started putting a Map together, with the studio name as the key and the list of students in that studio as the value. Right now, I'm not getting any output with this, but I'm sure it's something stupid. I'll put in logs tomorrow and figure it out. | 5 | |
| 5/1/20 | I AM HOPPING MAD. I spent a bajillion years trying to output my stupid teacher map before I realized that I needed to use .key and .value to get the key and value--for about an hour I was trying to use string values to get at the key and value. Don't even ask me what planet I was on during that time; it's clearly not a place worth going. All's well that ends well, though...I've got my teacher leaderboards. Today I also got my individual student log search function working--YAY! However, the bummer is that I now need to remember how to clear the output off the page after the user navigates away from the page. I remember it has something to do with setting a boolean ON the page to false, and then setting it to true when there are results? I'll have to pore over my project 4 from last semester tomorrow. I'm also super TODO-happy lately, and added some new TODOs into my classes...I even put one in my tests! | 5 | |
| 5/2/20 | Today, I started the practice hack display. Because this is one of the pages on which all three user types see VERY different information, I basically built a skeleton of what I want to do and then sat there staring at it, trying to figure out what exactly I wanted to do. I'm wondering whether each student having multiple teachers is a really bad idea for right now. I might limit each student account to one teacher for now, even though my database is capable of handling that relationship as a many-to-many. I can just moderate it at the front end, and leave the database as-is for easy scalability later. | 5 | |
| 5/3/20 | I mostly worked through my code review of Sarah's project. It was fun to really dive into someone else's work AND it was useful to try out some of the code quality tools--I've still got SonarLint installed and it is giving me the BUSINESS all day every day...but I'm not listening to it all the time because I'm a problem child, I guess. I also talked through my practice hack output problem with my husband, and decided that I AM going to limit each student to one studio at a time for now. There are several bits of student functionality that are going to be way easier to implement this way, and I think I'll be able to build a much nicer app because of that. It's hard letting go of something, but I feel a little less weighed down now that I have. | 4 | |
| 5/4/20 | Well, today was join/leave studio day for students, and WOAH, it wreaked a little bit of havoc. First, I had to learn the hard way after several "all-is-lost" moments that to update a bridging table you can ONLY run saveOrUpdate() on the side that has all the joinColumn annotations, so that was fun (and a big relief when it worked out). Once I got it working the way I wanted, it turned out that my student practice hack display was a bit broken, so I had to delve into that whole thing again to work out which variables I needed to add to/clear from the session (and _where_ all that even needed to happen) but it's all good now. I'm updating this on 5/5, so some of this stuff actually happened on 5/4 and some of it happened today. I'm about to start working on some create/update forms now, though, so I'll write about my progress there in the 5/5 slot. | 6 | |
| 5/5/20 | I had a really, really big All-Is-Lost moment today. Before getting stuck into my teacher Admin tasks, I decided to mess around in my tests where I discovered that there was a horrible cascade leak somewhere that was causing the deletion of a User to clear out most of my database. It is a small miracle that I discovered this in my tests before doing it for real; I must've already known in my heart that there was a problem. It took me a couple hours to figure out where it was, but it was ultimately pretty painless to patch it up. Once I got teacher admin working, I fixed up some display issues that were worrying me (if studios have no students, I don't want them to display on the leaderboards on the teacher's dashboard). I also made a slightly kinder UI with a pinch of friendly UX so that users take deleting studios seriously. Tomorrow, I'm going to work on inserting/deleting (and potentially editing) a practice hack and I'm finally going to get the Practice Log form hooked up to the inevitably crazy Servlet it's going to need to carry out its functionality correctly. I've decided that teacher comments on logs is going to be V.Next--these three user types have made this app an INCREDIBLE amount of work, but I'm proud of what I've achieved, I think. It's required some fun out-of-the-box thinking for sure! | 7 | |
| 5/6/20 | Today, I finally had to break down and make a change to the date formatting in my database. On the one hand, UGH, but on the other hand, my practice logging is working as expected (to the best of my knowledge)!!!! I even found a handy custom JSTL tag solution that allowed me to format the LocalDateTimes as LocalDates--thanks StackOverflow! Once that was over, I added login, 500, 404, and 403 error pages. I also _FINALLY_ added most of my JSPs and Servlets to the security portion of my Web.xml file. After all that, I had the courage to look at my project plan and check off a couple more boxes. Tomorrow, I'm going to focus on creating users, and creating/editing practice hacks. Here's my current plan for the rest of the week: Thursday--finish MVP CRUD items. Friday--CLEAN UP YOUR STYLES, SILLY! Saturday/Sunday--Work out this ridiculous API situation. I might have to use Mockaroo--the API I had dreamed of obviously doesn't *really* exist in the wild. Someday, I swear I'm going to build it...but before next Wednesday? Ain't gonna happen. So we'll see what I can hash out. I'm going to make it. | 7 | If I meet all my goals this week, Mon-Tues will be (hopefully) panic-coding-free AWS deployment + UX touch-ups + video stuff days. Fingers crossed! |
