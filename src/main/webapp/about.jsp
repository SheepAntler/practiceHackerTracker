        <p class="text-center">They say that it takes 10,000 hours of focused, dedicated work to master a skill.</p>

            As musicians, we know the value of hard work&mdash;arguably more than most. However, we also all live in a
            workaholic society in which our attentions are constantly being pulled in a million different directions;
            with obligations to work, school, and family, it can be difficult to create a practice schedule
            we can stick to.

            Fortunately, in this highly technological age, there are multiple applications out there that are designed
            to help people make goals and achieve them. Every activity from drinking water
            to training for a marathon is trackable and measurable via some mobile or web application. There are even
            apps for tracking practice sessions; however, we felt that the extant ones were missing a couple of key
            features.

            Whether you are learning something new or maintaining your current skillset, playing a musical instrument
            is an inherently communal activity. Teachers need to be able to keep tabs on students, and musicians need to
            be able to share progress and ideas with one another. With the Practice{Hacker} application, teachers,
            students, and amateur/professional musicians all over the country will be able to track their own practice
            sessions as well as view feedback from others. Pretty neat, eh?

        <hr />
        <p>
            Each user, be they a student, teacher, or a musician living out in the wild, will have the ability to track
            their practice sessions in our app. Each consecutive day that you log a session, another day will be added
            to a practice counter saved to your account. We'll also keep track of your longest practice streaks.
        </p>

        <p>
            What happens if you miss a day? No problemo&mdash;you won't lose any of your logs or practice notes; we'll
            just reset your counter to 0 and you can start working your way back up to your current longest streak,
            whatever it may be. Every time you beat your old practice streak, we'll replace it with your new count.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your logs are places for you to keep track of practice techniques and ideas that you found helpful each day.
            They're also little time capsules for you, so you can see what you were working on last week, last month,
            and last year. It's nice to have a way to visualize your progress sometimes!
